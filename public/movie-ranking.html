<h1>The best movies according to Marina</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited away</h3>
<p>It's an amazing movie. All japanese movies are just so amazing. I wish I watched sooner</p>
<h3>Almost Christmas</h3>
<p>Supper funny. I always watch it on Christmas<br />
    A little tip: get milk and coockies <br >
</p>
<h3>Taxi</h3>
<p>Most of you probably think about the american movie with Queen Latifah, 
    but I am talking about the french movie taxi. There are multiple of them, similar to
the fast and the furious. My trully favourite on is Taxi 4.<br />
Tipp: You should watch the first 3 movies to get the jokes in the fourth one <br /> </p>
